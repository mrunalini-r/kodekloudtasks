Nautilus developers are actively working on one of the project repositories, /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog. 
They were doing some testing and created few test branches, now they want to clean those test branches. 
Below are the requirements that have been shared with the DevOps team:

On Storage server in Stratos DC delete a branch named xfusioncorp_blog from /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog git repo.

cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/blog
 git branch -a
git checkout master

git branch --delete xfusioncorp_blog
//to check all the branches
