The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repositories /opt/games.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp directory. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.



Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/games, further add/commit the file and push to the master branch.
// copy the index file to storage server
sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp

//connect to the storage server
ssh natasha@ststor01

//switch user
sudo su
copy the file
cp /tmp/index.html  .

git add index.html

git commit -m "add index.html"

git push -u origin master
